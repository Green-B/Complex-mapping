# Complex mapping
This tool takes user-drawn curves from one copy of the complex plane and maps them to another. Use this to explore how complex maps deform curves.

### Controls
The left complex plane is for you to draw curves in. As you draw a curve, it will be mapped at the same time to the complex plane on the right.
- *Left mouse button*: Draw a curve by clicking and holding. You can draw multiple curves by clicking and holding again.  
- *Scroll wheel*: Zoom in and out.
- *Buttons in application*: Use these to define your own complex map. Note that the application expects input to be written with all symbols explicit - all parentheses must be matched and multiplication must be written out with "*".

### Examples

By doubling angles, the map $f(z)=z^2$ maps the unit semicircle to the unit circle.

Rational functions map circles to circles, including lines, which can be thought of as circles with infinite radii.
