# Complex mapping

This tool takes user-drawn curves from one copy of the ocmplex plane and maps them to another. Click and hold with the left mouse button to draw a curve.

Pending updates and wish list:
- Add buttons to the rightmost axes to allow for user-defined functions. Currently $f(z) = z^2$ is a placeholder.
- Clean up the axes, e.g., make them square and center them
- Add a slider to control axis limits and zoom.
- Consider adding explanatory text in the tool.
- Consider adding a button to draw pre-defined curves such as circles.
